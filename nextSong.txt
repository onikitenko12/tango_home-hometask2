Save me from drowning in the sea
Beat me up on the beach
What a lovely holiday
There's nothing funny left to say
This somber song would drain the sun
But it won't shine until it's sung
No water running in the stream
The saddest place we've ever seen
Everything I touched was golden
Everything I loved got broken
On the road to Mandalay
Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way
Bum bum bum ba da dum bum bum
Bum bum bum ba da dum bum bum
Bum bum bum ba da dum bum bum
Bum ba dum
There's nothing left for you to give
The truth is all that you're left with
Twenty paces then at dawn
We will die and be reborn
I like to sleep beneath the trees
Have the universe at one with me
Look down the barrel of a gun
And feel the moon replace the sun
Everything we've ever stolen
Has been lost returned or broken
No more dragons left to slay
Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way
Bum bum bum ba da dum bum bum
Bum bum bum ba da dum bum bum
Bum bum bum ba da dum bum bum
Bum ba dum
Bum bum bum ba da dum bum bum
Ba da da da da dum bum bum
Ba da da da da dum bum bum
Bum ba dum
Save me from drowning in the sea
Beat me up on the beach
What a lovely holiday
There's nothing funny left to say
